My personal emacs config

 * You will need to do a `M-x byte-recompile-directory` because `*.elc` is in `.gitignore`
 * Features `vim` emulation including extensive custom textobjects and motions
 * Extensive versioned backup system including file positions, registers, undo history etc.
 * Does everything you'd expect an emacs to do: email, web browsing, multimedia, file managing etc.
 * Everything that can be made fuzzy (sublime style) has been made fuzzy
 * Several powerful completion systems, including `ido`, `smex`, and
   * [Icicles](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles)
   * [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm)
 * Extremely agressive file autoloading, and fast startup times (relative)
